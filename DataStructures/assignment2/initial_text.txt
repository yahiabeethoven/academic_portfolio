When participating in an online class it is important to interact with your peers in an appropriate manner. Always use professional language (no netspeak) in your discussion Slack posts and emails. Please be respectful of your classmates at all times even if you disagree with their ideas.

Online learning includes a commitment NOT to: 1) record video or audio, 2) take screenshots, or 3) quote texts or chats from an online course without explicit consent from the instructor and fellow students. It forbids capturing, reposting, sharing, or distributing in any form other participants conversations, opinions, or course materials (including presentations, quizzes, and exams). If recordings are required in the event of guest lectures or for other purposes, such as remote instruction or accessibility, those arrangements will be made as a part of course planning and made clear to the relevant participants. An effective online learning community requires participation in various ways. Among these are attending real-time (synchronous) class meetings as scheduled, with the same attendance expectations as regular classroom meetings.
