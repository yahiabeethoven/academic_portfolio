# Mr. Miyagis, Was it You? by Joonha, Tonya, Beethoven and Pam.

Project Name: Mr. Miyagis, Was it You?


Project Description:

The purpose of this project is to offer a platform through which one can rethink the ways in which we perceive sexual harassment. This is an interactive web that provides a fictional short film with conventions of crime dramas that portrays the normalized act of sexual harassment but through a non-conventional story. By breaking stereotypes about the victim and the perpetrator but nevertheless still existent on ‘conventional spaces’ where sexual harassment takes place, we invite the audience to engage by listening to the victim’s story while trying to find the perpetrator. More importantly, besides raising the importance of listening to the victim, this film treats sexual harassment as a case of a serious and iminent crime. 
The interactive elements of our web page allows the audience to question their experiences, learn about it through the resources section and reflect upon the theme by ending with a small quiz. 


# Process:

This page is to raise awareness about an issue that happens often on campus and outside of the NYUAD community. The target audience is the NYUAD community given the relatability of the location chosen, which is a common club students go to, and other small hints such as the nyuad campus on the resources section. 
Joonha did an amazing job on the architecture and engineering of the web page in terms of responsiveness and interactivity! Amazing responsiveness (I am sorry okay, it is very exciting!!)
 
Tonya worked on the wireframe layout/ design. She used photoshop and her amazing searching skills to merge features that would respond to our theme, such as the party type font and darker colors). We constantly  communicated to discuss certain aesthetic features. Beethoven worked on the resources section. 

Pam: I think our short film is fairly good given the time constraints assigned to us to shoot on a weekend! 

In this link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LQgYoX8sjahwgVfL_Gxs0Xqm2cOt3xLw?usp=sharing )you can access the archive of the shooting process itself: the script, the production, the storyboard and the shots order excel sheet as well. Most of the shots are originally filmed by us, except a couple of them (the establishing shots) that we got from pexels.com and youtube.com. All of us acted in the film (even Joonha who did not visually appear). 
I am grateful I have friends who helped us with the production and scene prompts. Thank you Emilia, Lucas, and Anushka. Anant Singh is not part of this class but he was of great help as he was the cinematographer. 


# Reflection/Evaluation:

Although I wasn't very excited about the script we chose because it needed a lot of work in terms of development as well as I had to do a completely new storyboard, as well I think the film lacked a bit of depth about the psyche of the characters(there were many), but unavoidably this happened as a result of the creative constraint of trying not to exceed the 6min length. Furthermore, I knew it was going to be difficult to make it a realistic depiction of a club, given the limited budget and lack of mobility. However, I actually think it became really powerful to show that these events happen in a recognizable space such as dorms, because this also happens on campus. 
I wish we could have explore the psychological consequences of sexual assault for the victims as well as depicting the correlation between mental health (example childhood traumas) and the motives of the perpetrator, as well as to have provided more in depth analysis between male gaze, patriarchal structures even in non-heteronormative spaces(because as you saw in the film sexual harassment also happens among the same genders!!!!) . For the next film it will be!
